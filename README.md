### Description 
Hi! My name is Anastasiia, and this is my first GitHub repo. Here I practice my skills at writing markdown texts, LaTeX formulas and other fun things like that. I hope for 100 points 😏

### My favourite university subjects 
Currently my favourite subjects are:
1. Basics of AI and data mining
2. Analytical geometry
3. Coding 

### Online VS Offline studying
Here is what I thing about each of the studying options:
| Online | Offline|
|--------|--------|
|You can sleep more; stydy anytime and anywhwre | Easier to focus without distractions

### My favourite math formulas
Here are some of my favourite math formulas: 
$$
a^2=b^2+c^2
$$
, - this is the Pythagorean teorem;
$$
ax^2+bx+c=0
$$
, - this is the quadratic formula
$$
H=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{x_1}+\frac{1}{x_2}+\dots + \frac{1}{x_n}}
$$
, - this is the hamonic mean

### My coding skills
I am skilled enought to do some coding - here is one of the examples:
```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std; 

int main () {
    cout << "Hello, GitHub!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Use this [web-compiler](https://cpp.sh) to check the code out. In this example, the `main()` function prints "Hello, GitHub" messege. 

### The image I like 
Here is the image I personally like: it represents a place where I have been to once and which still makes me feel better.
